Hello, wonderful people! I'm Patrick Hoydar, and the goal of this document is to introduce myself and tell you about what it's like to work with me.

## Miscellaneous must-mentions
_I use this section to cover anything I really want people to know about me, but that would be strange to bring up out of the blue._

### About Me
I'm energized by creating and cultivating solid relationships with people. It's my belief that highly effective teams are built on a base of deep trust and vulnerability. The book [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/the-book/) influenced my work (and personal life) style deeply, and I think it's a great read for anyone. 

You don't need to know me long to discover that I love to crack jokes and create a space for fun and laughter. With that in mind, it's ok for you to nudge me and let me know we need to get back on task, lol. I won't take offense. Speaking of nudging, don't be afraid to give me a friendly reminder if you think I forgot about something. I've spent the last few years training myself and learning tools to help with remembering things, but I'm not perfect. 

## 1:1s
_What a successful 1:1 looks like..._

### 1:1s with my manager

- Don't be afraid to start with a personal catch up. I want to know how you are doing and what's going on in your life (what you're comfortable sharing, of course). Strong relationships help build strong teams. 
- Talk about professional/personal/career development for me
- Talk about ways I can do things better or how to tackle specific situations
- Not a status update meeting. We have tools for that. (how well are things going, not what's been checked off the task list
- Talk about things that I’m bothered by in our organization
_(Not all of these in one conversation)_

### 1:1s with peers [todo]
_Why do you have 1:1s with other people? What are you trying to get out of it?_

- I want to know how you're doing and that's not limited to work. What's something exciting or tough going on in your life?  
- You drive the agenda. I may have some talking points that are important, but this meeting is for you and you shouldn't have to sit and listen to my voice for 30 minutes straight. 
- What are your professional goals and what's your plan to achieve them? _(For example, if you say that you want to get into public speaking, I’ll remember to start sending you CFPs in the future!)_
- I like hearing what others are working on and thinking about ways our work overlaps or how we can help each other. 

## Communication
- Default to a slack message when possible. I check my email, but it's also easy for things to get lost in there sometimes. 
- I may take some time to digest what I just heard, so if I don't have an opinion right off the bat don't think that I didn't hear what you said. I'm trying to process the info so I can reply in a valuable way. 

## Motivators
_People are motivated by different things at work. When do you feel happy or accomplished? When do you feel demotivated? What makes you feel rewarded or recognized?_

I feel encouraged when the team is succeeding. I'm not great at taking compliments (doesn't mean I don't like them, ha) , but I love to tell others when they are doing things well. 

I feel discouraged when I've let someone down or when someone feels unheard or unappreciated. We're all in this together and I love the feeling a solid team win. 

## Hours
- Home base is Buford, Ga (30 northwest of Atlanta, GA)
- I generally start my day around 7am by helping get the kids ready to get sent off to school/daycare. This is usually when I start casually checking email and slack messages, but I'm not in work mode quite yet.
- I usually end my "on slack and zoom" portion of the workday at 4pm when both kids are home.
- Evening work hours are pretty common for me, but that doesn't mean you have to reply to an email or slack if you are done for the day..

## Meetings
- I'd prefer not to have meetings after 4pm, but by no means do I get grumpy about it. I simply prefer being done around the time my daughter gets home from school which is why I try to start early in the morning. 
- If there is no agenda, I will be reaching out to the meeting creator before I accept

## Feedback
_I like to think that if you tell people how to give you feedback, they’ll be more likely to give it._

- Give it to me straight. I do my best to lead with trust, so if you have constructive feedback for me then I  trust that it's coming from a genuine place. Hit me with it. 
- I will do my best deliver feedback in the tone you need it to be delivered whether it be praise or constructive

#### Disclaimer
This is a living document. It's the first time I've ever written on of these, so I'm sure the next time I come back to it I'll see plenty of things I left out or that I want to update. If you have any feedback I'd love to hear it!
